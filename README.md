# ‚úàÔ∏è Real-Time Airline Review Processing Pipeline

This project implements a **real-time data pipeline** for processing airline reviews using **Azure cloud services**. Reviews are ingested through **Azure Event Hubs**, analyzed for sentiment using **Azure Cognitive Services**, stored in **Cosmos DB**, and **negative reviews trigger Slack alerts**. The results are then visualized in **Power BI**.

## üìä Architecture Overview

| Component              | Description                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Event Hubs**         | (`rtpipeline-eh`) Ingests real-time review data.                             |
| **Logic Apps**         | (`rtpipeline-logic-app`) Orchestrates data flow based on Event Hub triggers. |
| **Cognitive Services** | (`rtpipeline-text-an`) Performs sentiment analysis (Text Analytics API).     |
| **Cosmos DB**          | (`rtpipeline-cosmosdb`) Stores enriched review data with sentiment scores.   |
| **Slack**              | Sends notifications for negative reviews via webhook.                        |
| **Power BI**           | Visualizes sentiment trends and review insights.                             |
